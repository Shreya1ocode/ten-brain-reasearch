            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is brain research?</h3>
                <p>Brain research refers to the study of the brain and its functions, including neuroscience, cognition, memory, neuroimaging, and other related fields. It aims to understand brain activity, disorders, and the effects of treatments or interventions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This process helps the brain adapt to new experiences, learning, and recovery from injury.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How is brain research data collected?</h3>
                <p>Brain research data is typically collected using methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), EEG (Electroencephalography), behavioral assessments, and neuropsychological testing to study brain activity, structure, and function.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is cognitive neuroscience?</h3>
