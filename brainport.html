					<p>You’ve seen Virat Kohli & Cristiano Ronaldo acing their games i.e. cricket & football respectively.</p>

<p>But there is a lot that goes behind the scenes whether it’s the training process, consistency, fitness or keeping cool during challenging situations or getting back in the zone after losing a game.</p>

<p>In this episode, catch our Co-founder & CEO, Ria Rustagi, in conversation with Raj Vinayak where they talk about the mindset of an athlete, the training process, challenges, and Idols along with their mental health before, during & after the game.</p>

<p>We also did a ‘Braintastic’ experiment with Raj where he used Neuphony to unlock the true potential of his mind.</p>
